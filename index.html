        <h2>Offensive Books Are Not The Devil</h2>
        <p>Some people seem to think that because there are books that exist which offend them, and that they exist in libraries and libraries refuse to ban books, that libraries should be shut down, so as to avoid offending anyone (avoid offending them).</p>
        <h2>Libraries Exist As Places Of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>Libraries cannot ban books without going against their purpose. They are repositories of knowledge, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
        <h2>Censoring Of Some Knowldge Leads To Censoring Of All Knowledge</h2>
        <p>Any argument you could make to ban a problematic book could easily be turned around and used to ban a non-problemtic book, as well.</p>
